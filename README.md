# CS320 Final Project Readme

##### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  Utilizing both statis and dynamic testing helps make sure code is secure and functional. Using tools like Security Scanner (to find known vulnerabilities in Java) and FindBugs (which is a static code analyzer that searches for bugs) will both assist with that in the future. I can utilize Unit Tests to test small parts of my code as I go, Code Coverage to make sure all the unit tests fully cover the units in my code, and Integration Tests to make sure everything combines properly. 
  
##### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  Frequent conversations with the client and project managers will assist in making sure all requirements are accounted for. They are gathered initially before coding is started, but throughout the process there may be additional requirements that pop up which will require followup conversations. Communication is key in making sure all of the user needs are incorporated into the program. 
  
##### How do I approach designing software?
  I start by looking at the requirements and write out a plan or diagram to help map out the various components of the software. Once I have a good overview of the entire project, I can then divide it into smaller sections to help keep it all organized. When everything is broken into smaller sections, I will be able to have good groupings for the future unit tests to make sure the code works as expected.
